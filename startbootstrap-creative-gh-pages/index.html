                            An interactive weather map will be created to display real time weather data. The numerical data for temperature and 
                            humidity, as well as the local weather data for temperature and precipitation will be displayed on the piTFT. In addition, 
                            specific LEDs on a 32x32 LED Matrix will be assigned to 17 different locations in New York State. Each LED will be assigned 
                            a color that will correspond with the temperature and humidity. When the system is powered on there is a start screen followed
                            by four different user options. These options include:

                              Assigns LED colors based on the highest and lowest temperature values in New York State.</li>
                          <li>Relative Humidity: Displays humidity data for all of the selected locations on the piTFT along with a scale legend.

                          <li>Cities and Towns: Displays list of all selected cities and towns. When a location is chosen, the LED corresponding to the 
                              location turns on and the temperature and precipitation data for the selected location is displayed on the piTFT along 
                              with a weather icon.</li>
                          <li>Temperature: Displays temperature data for all of the selected locations on the piTFT along with a predefined scale legend. 
                              Assigns LED colors based on the set scale for temperature values (0 degrees F to 100 degrees F).</li>

                        <p class="text-black-75 mb-4">After we decided to do a weather map using LEDs for the project, we started thinking of potential 
                            implementation ideas of various features for the design. For hardware implementation we considered using LED strips for the 
                            map. This approach would involve sautering the LED strips together everytime the strip was cut. Instead of sautering the LED
                            strips together we decided to use a 32x32 LED mmatrix. This decision helped us remove sautering time and allowed us to focus 
                            on implementing more features of the system, while removing the concern for potential hardware issues from incomplete 
                            sautering. In addition, when planning the map we initially considered doing the entire United States. We decided that the area 
                            was too large to get the detail in location that we wanted the system to have and reduced the size to the northeast United States.
                            We further reduced the area to New York State after testing out different size maps on the LED matrix. 
                            One of the earliest ideas that we decided on for the software implementation was the ability for the
                            system to display the desired numerical weather data on the piTFT screen while the associated color was assigned to the LED 
                            for the location of that data point. We considered many different data points before deciding on a design. These data points 
                            included:
                        </p>
                        <li>Temperature</li>
                        <li>Humidity</li>
                        <li>Wind</li>
                        <li>Snow/Rain</li>
                        <li>Clouds</li>
                        <li>Pressure</li>
                        <li>Sunrise/Sunset</li>
                        <li>Real Time Data</li>
                        <li>Future Data</li>
                         <br>
                        <p>We wanted to implement multiple types of data collection that we could switch between to make sure that the LEDs were updating 
                            the new data and color correctly. We used Open Weather Map to collect the weather data using an API key. The free plan did not 
                            include access to future predicted data and we could only use real time data. We decided to collect temperature, humidity, and 
                            cloud/rain/snow data.

                            Raspberry-Pi, piTFT screen, and a 32x32 LED matrix. The Lab 3 kernel was used for the final project. The Raspberry-Pi was powered 
                            by the lab provided Raspberry-Pi power supply. The LED matrix was powered by a 5V power supply that attached directly to the back 
                            of the matrix. The LED matrix was attached to the Raspberry-Pi using a breadboard. The LED matrix had 16 pins that needed to be 
                            connected to the Raspberry-Pi. A diagram of the hardware is below:

                         <p>The hardware was tested by using a python code from Adafruit found <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/connecting-a-16x32-rgb-led-matrix-panel-to-a-raspberry-pi/experimental-python-code">here.</a>
                             The example code is attached at the end of the report called testLED.py
                         </p>
                        <p>When testing the code we saw several LEDs light up in colors red, white, and green. The code was written for a 16x32 LED
                                matrix, which resulted some of the LEDs not turning on during the initial test. We changed the code to be correctly sized 
                                for a 32x32 LED matrix by changing the range and adding a d_pin to 'set_row()' in the code. 
                        </p>
                        <p>During testing of the hardware we initially used a power supply that was powered by the lab power supply. At times, the LED 
                                matrix would not turn on when powered if there was not enough voltage from the power supply. We switched the power supply to 
                                a 5V plug in connector to an outlet. This provides a more reliable voltage for the LED matrix and we had no further issues 
                                with powering the LEDs.

                        <b>Setup API Key</b>
                        <p class="text-black-75 mb-4">The first step for software testing that was performed was getting an API key and collecting weather data.
                            We signed up for an account on Open Weather Map and got an API key from the website. The free plan allows for 60 calls a minute 
                            and 1,000,000 calls a month. The API key was implemented in the code API.py and API_with_LED.py that can be found at the end 
                            of the report. Throughout our progress on this project we made several updates to how we implemented the API call. Initially we 
                            used the latitude and longitude coordinates for the API call for the starting locations, such as in the below line of code. 
                        </p>
                        <i>response = requests.get(f"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={42.1435257}&lon={-77.0543408}&appid={api_key}",verify=False)</i>
                        <p>  </p>
                         <br> 
                         <p>This approach was time consuming, as we needed to find the correct latitude and longitude numbers for each location we wanted to map. 
                            Another approach to collecting weather data was used. Instead of inputting the latitude and longitude, we inputted the name of the 
                            location we wanted to get data for, such as in the below line of code.
                        </p>
                        <i>responseAlbany = requests.get(f"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Albany&limit=1&appid={api_key}",verify=False)</i>
                        <p>  </p>
                         <br>
                        <p>After getting a response, the staus code needs to be checked to confirm that data was collected. A staus code of 200 means that the data 
                            is collected. A status code of 403 means that data collection from Open Weather Map is down or data can not be collected at the time. 
                            An example of the data output from the API call for Albany, NY is below.
                        </p>
                        <i>{'coord': {'lon': -73.9662, 'lat': 42.6001}, 'weather': [{'id': 802, 'main': 'Clouds', 'description': 'scattered clouds', 'icon': '03d'}], 'base': 'stations', 'main': {'temp': 272.81, 'feels_like': 270.58, 'temp_min': 271.36, 'temp_max': 274.05, 'pressure': 1019, 'humidity': 50, 'sea_level': 1019, 'grnd_level': 990}, 'visibility': 10000, 'wind': {'speed': 1.79, 'deg': 228, 'gust': 7.6}, 'clouds': {'all': 49}, 'dt': 1734029447, 'sys': {'type': 2, 'id': 19530, 'country': 'US', 'sunrise': 1734005826, 'sunset': 1734038566}, 'timezone': -18000, 'id': 5106841, 'name': 'Albany', 'cod': 200}</i>
                        <p>  </p>
                         <br>
                        <p>The temperature, humidity, and precipitation data for the weather map was pulled from this response output. During our initial testing we 
                            noticed that the API would work well sometimes, but not work at other times. Initially, it was thought that on some occasions we would either 
                            call the API at the correct time when giving a signal or we would miss the signal. We added a while loop to run the API call and wait for 
                            incoming data. This approach did not work and the while loop ran for a minute before we stopped the code. Eventually when running the program 
                            again several minutes later, the API call worked on the first try. We realized that the issue was that after exceding the number of 
                            calls using the API, data could no longer be connected for several minutes. In order to address this issue, we created a sample set of 
                            data in the python code that could be used instead of running the API. This allowed us to not overuse the API key, while still being able to 
                            make progress on formatting the piTFT screen display and other features of the system.

                        <b>Setup LED Map</b>
                        <p>After working on setting up the API key, we worked on mapping out the LEDs that are used for each of the 17 locations. To plan out the LEDs 
                            the code workingLED.py was reate. This code is a modified version of the code testLED.py. The areas chosen as locations are listed below.

                        <p>During the process of choosing an LED, initially a small section of LEDs were turned on around each location. Slowly the area of LEDs that were
                            on was decreased and was narrowed down to one LED for each location. 
                        </p>
                        <p>When testing, we noticed some issues with the LEDs flickering. We read other reports for teams that used the LED matrix and talked with other groups
                            using an LED matrix. To solve this issue we created a for loop that turns off all of the LEDs. After the for loop, the LEDs used for each location 
                            are turned on. This sequence runs each time the LEDs are refreshed. This solution is implemented in the main code screen_with_LED.py

                         <b>Testing Issues</b>
                         <p>Other than the previously mentioned issues that were worked through involving the API data collection and the flickering LEDs, we also experienced issues with
                         using the touchscreen of the piTFT. Each time we turned on the Raspberry-Pi, the touch screen would have to be set up. 
                         </p>

                         <b>Other Considerations</b>
                         <p>We considered adding data about relative wind speed and relative cloud coverage to the user menu options. The data collection for this was set up but not implemented in the 
                          main code. Instead of these options, we instead implemented Temperature with fixed ranges for the incoming data and display.

                            This project successfully integrates hardware and software to create an interactive, real-time weather visualization system for 17 locations across New York State. By combining a Raspberry Pi, a piTFT touchscreen, and a 32x32 LED matrix, the system provides a unique and visually engaging way to explore live weather data. The system includes multiple features, such as the ability to display relative temperature and humidity values, as well as city-specific weather details like temperature, precipitation, and weather icons. The dynamic LED matrix enhances the user experience by visually representing data with color-coded LEDs corresponding to each location.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-black-75 mb-4">
                            The development process involved overcoming challenges, such as ensuring reliable power for the LED matrix and adapting the software for the 32x32 LED configuration. Using the OpenWeatherMap API allowed for accurate real-time data retrieval and seamless integration into the system. The interactive design and real-time updates make this weather map an intuitive and educational tool for visualizing complex data.

                            While the project successfully visualizes real-time weather data for New York State, several enhancements could further improve its functionality and expand its applications. One potential area of development is the inclusion of weather forecast data, which would allow users to view not only current conditions but also predicted weather trends for the next few days.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-black-75 mb-4">
                            Another improvement could be the addition of more locations to expand coverage beyond New York State, potentially to other regions or the entire United States. Incorporating additional weather parameters such as wind speed, air quality, or UV index could make the system more versatile and informative. Furthermore, integrating advanced visualizations, like animations for precipitation or wind direction, could enhance the user experience.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-black-75 mb-4">
                            Lastly, transitioning to a cloud-based API management system could improve scalability and reduce latency, especially when accessing large datasets or supporting multiple users. These enhancements would build on the current project’s strong foundation, increasing its usability and appeal for broader audiences, including educational institutions and public installations.
